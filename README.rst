Library and utilities to develop protocols and check for protocol compliance in medical imaging.

We use the term "protocol" here loosely, to refer to MRI acquisition protocols, or neuroimaging data QC protocols.

Current release focuses on MRI image acquisition protocols for QA purposes only.

--------

- simple tool to check for *protocol compliance* :
    ensure all subjects in a given dataset were acquired with same/compatible values for few key parameters.
- programmatic parsing of Siemens protocols in XML format
